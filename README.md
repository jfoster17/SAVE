# SAVE
Search Analysis and Visualization Environment

The Search Analysis and Visualization Environment is a component of the [Data+Climate collaboration](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/data-climate/home?pli=1), joining the diverse knowledge resources of [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org) with tools such as the [glue visualization library](http://glueviz.org)

## Components

The components of SAVE worked on or developed under the Data+Climate collaboration include:

- [glue-jupyter](https://glue-jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -- glue in a Jupyter notebook
- [glue-map](https://github.com/jfoster17/glue-map) -- a glue-jupyter plugin for the display and analysis of geo-spatial data, leveraging [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [xarray-leaflet](https://xarray-leaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- An customizable ipywidget showing how to dynamically add Data Commons data to an existing glue-jupyter session
- [ipyleaflet](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -- An ipywidget for display of maps using [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com)
- [xarray-leaflet](https://xarray-leaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -- to enable the visualization of large datasets efficiently

In addition, the following components are used in SAVE:

- [voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) -- to host a SAVE analysis session as a stand-alone webpage
- [voila gridstack](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila-gridstack]) -- the preference voila template to allow for easy organization of different visualizations on the same page.

## Examples

As part of the [Climate and Justice Design Fellowship](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/climatefellowship) under the Data+Climate pilot project, SAVE was used to:

- Conduct data analysis and export specific visualizations for the [California Map of Hazardous Waste Sites and Schools](https://ejhazardouswaste.com/) by Idalmis Vaquero

- Provide interactive visualizations for the [Blue-Lining](https://bluelining.org/) project by Carlos Claussel. A version of these interactive visualizations are available [here](https://glue-map-demo.net)
